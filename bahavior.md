# Behavior

This section lists various notes on behavior and mindset. Some items pull from industries outside software development but which could be useful to keep in mind and really apply to many aspects of life.

## FAA Hazardous Attitudes

The FAA points out five hazardous attitudes and how these can impact decision making. You should look out for these in yourself and others and work to mitigate these when needed.

Issues

- Impulsivity - when someone responds quickly without thinking things through
- Anti-authority - when someone doesn't want to be told what to do
- Macho - when someone's ego gets in their way and they want to prove people wrong
- Invulnerability - when someone thinks they can do no wrong
- Resignation - when someone feels hopeless about doing anything

Solutions

- Impulsivity - slow down and think things through
- Anti-authority - follow the rules since they are usually right
- Macho - taking chances is foolish, leave ego out of it
- Invulnerability - it could happen to me
- Resignation - you're not helpless and can make a difference

## - Apathy

Watch out for apathy in the workplace. Toxic cultures can shut down people and it's tough to change a culture once it's lost. Ideally teams are collaborative and self-reliant. Of course, people have different personality types but keep a pulse on the culture and work to empower people making their own decisions independently where appropriate.

## Perimeter of Ignorance

Be aware of your perimeter of ignorance. Keep a beginner's mind and work to learn new things. Problem solving is at the core of software development and most things in life.
