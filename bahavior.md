## FAA Hazardous Attitudes

The FAA points out five hazardous attitudes and how these can impact decision making. You should look out for these in yourself and others and work to mitigate these when needed.

Issues

- Impulsivity - when someone responds quickly without thinking things through
- Anti-authority - when someone doesn't want to be told what to do
- Macho - when someone's ego gets in their way and they want to prove people wrong
- Invulnerability - when someone thinks they can do no wrong
- Resignation - when someone feels hopeless about doing anything

Solutions

- Impulsivity - slow down and think things through
- Anti-authority - follow the rules since they are usually right
- Macho - taking chances is foolish, leave ego out of it
- Invulnerability - it could happen to me
- Resignation - you're not helpless and can make a difference

## Apathy

Watch out for apathy in the workplace. Toxic cultures can shut down people and it's tough to change a culture once it's lost. Ideally teams are collaborative and self-reliant. Of course, people have different personality types but keep a pulse on the culture and work to empower people making their own decisions independently where appropriate.

## Perimeter of Ignorance

Be aware of your perimeter of ignorance. Keep a beginner's mind and work to learn new things. Problem solving is at the core of software development and most things in life.

## STOP Skill

Before reacting to something take a moment to think things through. The [STOP skill](https://www.charliehealth.com/post/what-is-the-dbt-stop-skill) can help you make a mindful decision on how to proceed with something. This technique can help in life in general from stressful situations to even small interactions.

- S low down
- T ake a breath
- O bserve what youâ€™re feeling/thinking
- P roceed with a healthy thought or action based on what you need

## Acknowledge, Interrupt, Reframe

Acknowledging, interrupting and reframing things is an important skill for growth. It can help us change patterns in our lives from bad habits to interpersonal skills.

## Be Reasonably Unreasonable

Kevin Smith describes his approach to life and working toward goals in the video below. You should be reasonably unreasonable in dreaming big and working hard to get there. "Why not try to make your dreams come true?"

## Trust Others

Put trust in others and see how things go before intervening and giving more guidance. Set a goal or expectation and let someone prove themselves and give them autonomy to work through something on their own. Give people the benefit of the doubt to start with. Give them space to learn and grow and fail and then help if needed.

## Communication

Keep in mind that communication and listening are very important in work and life. It's easy for people to be on different pages when we think we're not. Consistent and central documentation can help with keeping people on track. Syncing with people regularly and as needed will help as well. [Tree swing cartoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_swing_cartoon) help illustrate how our internal visions can be misaligned.

The [telephone game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_game) is a great example of how communication can break down as information is passed from one person to the next. Team collaboration and communication is important, not only in working to ensure people are on the same page but giving people grace when mistakes are made.

The [beer game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game) is another example of the importance of communication and collaboration. Only by working together can a group of people manage a supply chain and not overwhelm each other.

## Proactive Communication

Be proactive in communication with teams and with management. Ensure people are getting the right amount of details in the right frequency. Setup a cadence early and get feedback on their expectations and check in if the cadence needs to be adjusted periodically.
