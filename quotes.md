"With building it's clear that it's unreasonable for clients to ask for a bid before telling you what you're going to build. Your clients wouldn't want you to show up with wood, hammer, and nails and start spending their money before the architect had finished the blueprints. People tend to understand software development less than they understand two-by-fours and sheetrock, however, so the clients you work with might not immediately understand why you want to plan requirements development as a separate project. You might need to explain your reasoning to them." - [Code Complete 2 page 56](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/code-complete-9780735619678)

Four rules of simple design:

- Passes the tests

"Computing is the only profession in which a single mind is obliged to span the distance from a bit to a few hundred megabytes, a ratio of 1 to 10^9, or nine orders of magnitude. 'Compared to that number of semantic levels, the average mathematical theory is almost flat. By evoking the need for deep conceptual hierarchies, the automatic computer confronts us with a radically new intellectual challenge that has no precedent in our history.'" - [Code Complete 2 page 78](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/code-complete-9780735619678)

"Dripping water hollows out stone, not through force but through persistence." - [Several People](https://wist.info/other/26191/)

"When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.

Give some respect to past decisions and existing code. We don't know what pressures the developers and team were under at the time. Spend some time gaining context. - [Related to Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence)

"Here’s the thing folks. I’ve been coding 32 years. When something like this happens it’s an organizational failure. Yes, some human wrote a bad line. Someone can “git blame” and point to a human and it’s awful. But it’s the testing, the Cl/CD, the A/B testing, the metered rollouts, an oh shit button to roll it back, the code coverage, the static analysis tools, the code reviews, the organizational health, and on and on. It’s always one line of code but it’s NEVER one person. Implying inclusion policies caused a bug is simplistic, reductive, and racist. 

Engineering is a team sport. Inclusion makes for good teams. Good engineering practices makes for good software. Engineering practices failed to find a bug multiple times, regardless of the seniority of the human who checked that code in. Solving the larger system thinking SDLC matters more than the null pointer check. 

This isn’t a “git gud C++ is hard” issue and it damn well isn’t an DEI one." - [Scott Hanslman on teamwork and blame](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shanselman_crowdstrike-activity-7220428353269350400-DyM4)

You have to believe that whatever someone is telling you is what they truly think in order to start understanding their perspective. Even if you don't agree, you just have to realize they believe something else and work to put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Then you can work to change their perspective or your own. - Adam Flater discussing what his father explained to him about communication

"Don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to ignorance." - [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)

“Almost everyone, almost always, is just trying to be helpful.” - Attributed to a Don Gray (?)

"Don't shave that yak!" - [Explained by Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/)

[https://medium.com/the-composition/a-taxonomy-of-yak-shaving-102da591308b](https://medium.com/the-composition/a-taxonomy-of-yak-shaving-102da591308b)

"Is the juice worth the squeeze?" - [juice is worth the squeeze](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/juice_is_worth_the_squeeze)

The Pickle Jar Theory is one way to organize tasks. Imagine your tasks as rocks, pebbles and sand. Important, time consuming and sensitive tasks would be the rocks, smaller tasks would be pebbles and the sand are things that fill in around those. We only have time for a few big tasks per day (the rocks), with a few smaller tasks (the pebbles) between them surrounded by our normal daily tasks (the sand) which aren't on a strict deadline.

### Continous Learning

"To reread at least monthly:

- 'I don’t know' is not an admission of ignorance. It’s an expression of intellectual humility.
- 'I was wrong' is not a confession of failure. It’s a display of intellectual integrity.
- 'I don’t understand' is not a sign of stupidity. It’s a catalyst for intellectual curiosity.

### Team Work

"I think the other way you grow your scope overtime is, I think you begin to value everybody running in the same direction, even if the direction is 3 degrees off ideal... A whole team pulling 98 degrees correct versus like half the team pulling 100% correct and the other half debating them on which is correct, I think the team pulling together is gonna get further... This is what Amazon means by disagree and commit." - [Philip Su (in conversation with Ryan Peterman at 1:05:42)](https://youtu.be/v2JxdjTi_1I?si=wzoBTsn_EDDu1W2O&t=3942)
