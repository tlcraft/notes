## Disaster Recovery Plans

Many things could occur to disrupt normal operation of your software. It could range from a natural disaster, an accident or nefarious actors attempting to impact your application. When an outage occurs, it is important to know how you will react. Depending on the size and scope of the application the response can range from simply waiting if that's reasonable to deploying the application to another region. In some cases, the application will already be built to handle large server outages by being cross-region. Below are a number of links discussing important disaster recovery concepts to keep in mind.
