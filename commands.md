### cd

`cd` lets us change between directories. You can use a dash to jump back to your last directoy, like `cd -`.

### cat

The `cat` command can print the contents of a file to standard output. It can do other things like concatenating file contents together as well.

This example will print the contents of `filename` to the terminal.

```bash
cat filename
```

### dig

The `dig` command queries domain name system (DNS) servers. It's useful for troubleshooting DNS problems. 

The `+trace` flag will run iterative queries to list the DNS lookup path. Such as `dig google.com +trace`.

The `+x` flag will run a reverse DNS lookup. Like `dig +noall +answer -x 8.8.8.8`.

### grep

`grep` can be used to find instances of a given pattern within a file. It will print each line that includes a match. Note from the documentation, "since newline is also a separator for the list of patterns, there is no way to match newline characters in a text."

### ifconfig

`ifconfig` can be run on Unix-like systems, such as macOS, to configure or query network interface parameters.

- [ifconfig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig)

### ipconfig

From Microsoft's documentation, `ipconfig` in Windows "displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings. Used without parameters, `ipconfig` displays Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6 addresses, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters."

### ping

The `ping` command tests if a device on a network is reachable.

### sed

The `sed` command can help you manipulate text from files. For example, it can be useful to use if you need to replace some text per a configuration or environment.

From the documentation below, here's an example which replaces instances of `hello` with `world` in the `input.txt` file and outputs the changes to `output.txt`.

```shell
sed 's/hello/world/' input.txt > output.txt
```

### tree

The `tree` command prints the directory structure from the folder where you run the command.
